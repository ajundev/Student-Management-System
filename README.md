# Student Management System
This project is a C++ application called "Student Management System" that helps a university migrate its existing student system to a new platform using the C++ language. The application is designed to manage a roster of students for a given course by reading, storing, and manipulating student data. The system allows for the addition, removal, and modification of student information based on the provided requirements.
